# playing-jsmessages
Basic example to compute localized messages of Play Application on client side

Basically, [Play JsMessages](https://github.com/julienrf/play-jsmessages) library takes the i18n messages of our Play application, sends them to the client-side as a JSON object and defines a JavaScript function returning a message value from a given language and the message key and arguments.
